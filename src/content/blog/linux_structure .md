# Linux Structure

## Definition and Basics
- **Linux** is an operating system (OS) similar to Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.
- The primary role of an OS is to manage hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage) and provide an interface for software to interact with hardware.
- Linux is unique because:
  - It is **free** and **open-source**, meaning anyone can view, modify, and distribute its source code.
  - It comes in various **distributions** ("distros") tailored to different use cases, such as Ubuntu for desktops, CentOS for servers, and Android for mobile devices.

## History
- **1991**: Linux began as a personal project by Finnish student **Linus Torvalds**, who wanted to create a free Unix-like operating system.
- **Unix Influence**: Linux was inspired by Unix, an OS developed in the 1970s, and the **GNU Project**, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman to create free software.
- **License**: Linux is distributed under the **GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2)**, ensuring it remains free and open-source.
- **Growth**:
  - From a few files in 1991, Linux has grown to over **23 million lines of source code**.
  - It now powers a wide range of devices, including:
    - **Smartphones** (e.g., Android is based on the Linux kernel).
    - **Servers** (e.g., most web servers run Linux).
    - **Mainframes**, **supercomputers**, and **embedded systems** (e.g., IoT devices).

## Philosophy
The Linux philosophy is based on simplicity, modularity, and flexibility. Its core principles include:

1. **Everything is a file**:
   - In Linux, everything (devices, processes, configurations) is treated as a file.
   - Example: `/dev/sda` represents a hard drive, and `/etc/passwd` stores user account information.

2. **Small, single-purpose programs**:
   - Linux tools are designed to perform one task exceptionally well.
   - Example: `grep` searches for text patterns, while `ls` lists directory contents.

3. **Ability to chain programs**:
   - Programs can be combined using pipes (`|`) to perform complex tasks.
   - Example: `ls | grep "file"` lists files containing "file" in their name.

4. **Avoid captive user interfaces**:
   - Linux emphasizes the use of the **shell** (command-line interface) for greater control and automation.
   - Example: Bash, Zsh, and Fish are popular shells.

5. **Configuration data stored in text files**:
   - System configurations are stored in plain text files, making them easy to edit and version control.
   - Example: `/etc/fstab` defines how file systems are mounted.

## Components of Linux
Linux is composed of several key components that work together to provide a functional operating system:

### 1. **Bootloader**
   - The bootloader is responsible for starting the Linux kernel during the boot process.
   - Example: **GRUB** (GRand Unified Bootloader) is commonly used in Linux distributions.

### 2. **OS Kernel**
   - The kernel is the core of the operating system, managing hardware resources and providing essential services to applications.
   - Responsibilities:
     - **Process management**: Handles running processes and multitasking.
     - **Memory management**: Allocates and deallocates memory.
     - **Device drivers**: Interfaces with hardware devices.
     - **File system management**: Manages data storage and retrieval.

### 3. **Daemons**
   - Daemons are background services that run continuously to perform essential tasks.
   - Examples:
     - `cron`: Schedules tasks.
     - `sshd`: Manages SSH connections.
     - `httpd`: Runs a web server.

### 4. **OS Shell**
   - The shell is the command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.
   - Popular shells:
     - **Bash**: Default shell in many Linux distributions.
     - **Zsh**: Advanced shell with additional features.
     - **Fish**: User-friendly shell with auto-suggestions.

### 5. **Graphics Server**
   - The graphics server enables graphical applications to run.
   - Example: **X-server** (or simply "X") is a common graphics server.

### 6. **Window Manager**
   - The window manager provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the system.
   - Examples:
     - **GNOME**: Modern and user-friendly.
     - **KDE**: Highly customizable.
     - **MATE**: Lightweight and traditional.

### 7. **Utilities**
   - Utilities are small programs that perform specific tasks.
   - Examples:
     - `cp`: Copies files.
     - `mv`: Moves or renames files.
     - `top`: Monitors system processes.

## Linux Architecture (Layers)
Linux architecture is organized into layers, each with a specific role:

1. **Hardware**:
   - Physical components such as the CPU, RAM, hard drive, and network interfaces.

2. **Kernel**:
   - The core of the operating system that interacts directly with hardware.
   - Provides services like process scheduling, memory management, and device communication.

3. **Shell**:
   - The command-line interface that allows users to execute commands and interact with the kernel.

4. **System Utilities**:
   - Tools and applications that provide additional functionality to users and administrators.

## File System Hierarchy
Linux organizes files and directories in a hierarchical structure. Key directories include:

- `/`:
  - The root directory, containing all other directories and files.
  - Example: `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`.

- `/bin`:
  - Essential command binaries required for basic system operation.
  - Example: `ls`, `cat`, `cp`.

- `/boot`:
  - Contains bootloader files, the kernel, and other files needed to boot the system.
  - Example: `vmlinuz` (kernel image).

- `/dev`:
  - Contains device files representing hardware devices.
  - Example: `/dev/sda` (hard drive), `/dev/tty` (terminal).

- `/etc`:
  - Stores system configuration files.
  - Example: `/etc/fstab` (file system table), `/etc/passwd` (user accounts).

- `/home`:
  - User-specific directories for storing personal files.
  - Example: `/home/username`.

- `/lib`:
  - Shared library files required by system programs.
  - Example: `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`.

- `/media`:
  - Mount point for removable devices like USB drives and CDs.

- `/mnt`:
  - Temporary mount point for file systems.

- `/opt`:
  - Optional or third-party software.

- `/root`:
  - Home directory for the root (superuser) account.

- `/sbin`:
  - System administration binaries.
  - Example: `ifconfig`, `reboot`.

- `/tmp`:
  - Temporary files created by applications.

- `/usr`:
  - Contains user programs, libraries, and documentation.
  - Example: `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`.

- `/var`:
  - Variable data files, such as logs, emails, and web files.
  - Example: `/var/log`, `/var/www`.
