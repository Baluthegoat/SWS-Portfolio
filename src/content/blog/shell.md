## Shell 

A **shell** is a text-based interface between users and the kernel, enabling command execution to control the system. It is also referred to as the **command line** or **console**. The shell's primary functions include navigating directories, working with files, retrieving system information, and executing system commands.

## 1. Terminal Emulators

**Terminal emulators** are software applications that emulate terminal functionality within a graphical user interface (GUI). They act as intermediaries between the user and the shell interpreter, enabling text-based program execution in a graphical environment.

### **Functionality**:
- Provides an interface for command execution.
- Supports multiple command-line interfaces (CLI) within one terminal.
- Enables remote system interaction.
- Processes text-based input/output operations.

## 2. Terminal Multiplexers

**Terminal multiplexers** allow users to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.

### **Purpose and Features**:
- Split terminal windows for multitasking.
- Create separate workspaces.
- Work in multiple directories simultaneously.
- Manage multiple terminal sessions.
- Example: **Tmux** (Terminal Multiplexer).

  - Advanced customization options.
  - Enhanced completion system.
- **Fish Shell**:
  - User-friendly interactive features.
  - Modern command-line interface.
  - Built-in help system.
