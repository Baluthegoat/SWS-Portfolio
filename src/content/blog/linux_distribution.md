# Linux Distributions

## Overview
- **Linux distributions (distros)** are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel.
- Each distribution includes:
  - The **Linux kernel** (core of the OS).
  - A **package manager** for installing and managing software.
  - A set of **default applications** (e.g., text editors, browsers, utilities).
  - Optional **desktop environments** for graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- Distros are tailored for specific purposes, such as:
  - **Servers**: High performance, stability, and security.
  - **Embedded devices**: Lightweight and resource-efficient.
  - **Desktops**: User-friendly and feature-rich.
  - **Mobile phones**: Optimized for touch interfaces (e.g., Android).
